# Wastewater-Reuse-Opportunities

The need to more efficiently manage water is a key element in the sustainability discussion.  The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) has been assigned the task of identifying water supply options and future needs for Texas.  The state has been divided into 16 regional planning areas with Regional Water Planning Groups (RWPGs) responsible for developing regional water plans (RWPs) to address each region's needs.  The RWPs are reveiwed and updated on a designated basis.

Harris county and surrounding counties are assigned to Region H.  

This evaluation briefly introduces information from the most recent Region H plan and identifies a potential missed opportunity for wastewater resuse.
