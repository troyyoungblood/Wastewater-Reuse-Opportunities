# Wastewater-Reuse-Opportunities


Summary
<p>This evaluation introduces information from the most recent Texas Water Development Board water management plan for the southeast Texas region designated as Region H and identifies a potential missed opportunity for wastewater resuse. 

<p>The need to more efficiently manage water is a key element in long term sustainability.  The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) has been assigned the task of identifying water supply options and future needs for Texas.  The state has been divided into 16 regional planning areas with Regional Water Planning Groups (RWPGs) responsible for developing regional water plans (RWPs) to address each region's needs. Harris county and surrounding counties are assigned to Region H of the regional planning areas. The RWPs are reveiwed and updated on a designated basis.</p>
  
The Region H plan identifies a project for reuse of treated industrial wastewater in the Harris and Brazoria county area.  The project is scheduled to be implemented in the 2060 decade and is expected to have a supply of 67,200 ac-ft/yr.   A review of Annual Waste Summaries submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality indicates approximately 4,800 ac-ft/year of industrial wastewater (hazardous and Class 1 nonhazardous) was generated in 2020 in Harris and Brazoria county.  Class 2 wastes, in general, are not required to be reported in the Annual Waste Summary and therefore the amount of wastewater available for reuse is expected to be much higher.  A conservative estimate is 2,000 ac-ft/year of industrial wastewater is available for reuse in the Harris and Brazoria county areas.  An additional 1,000 ac-ft/year of hazardous wastewater could be available with review and minor treatment.  While the quantity available today is only 4.5% of the estimated overall supply 40+ years from now, finding opportunities for use of the water by 2030 could add 90,000 ac-ft from 2030 to 2060 of valuable water back into the system while the larger project is being finsished.

The wastewater is currently being generated and in most cases is shipped offsite in a tanker or drums, depending on the volume generated at the site. The section of the state regulations that regulates, and potential limits, reuse is identified in volume 1, Section 3.4.

There are opportunities for treatment would could move some of these wastes into the candidate category and those opportunities should be explored. </p>
